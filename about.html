        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>This weather dashboard project was created to provide real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. It also offers a 5-day weather forecast and information on previous weather cautions in the selected city.</p>
        <p>Using the OpenWeatherMap API, users can search for any city and get accurate weather data instantly.</p>
        <p> 
        The goal of this mini-project is to create a Weather Dashboard that provides real-time weather data, along with additional features such as a 5-day forecast, 
        previous weather cautions, and pages for general information (about, contact). This project involves web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a fully functional,
         responsive weather application.<br>

        Displays past weather cautions (e.g., heatwaves, thunderstorms, air quality warnings) for the selected city.
        Uses stored data or an API to fetch real-world previous weather warnings.<br>
