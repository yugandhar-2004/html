    <p>The giant panda has lived in bamboo forests for several million years. It is a highly specialized animal, with unique adaptations.<br> The panda's thick, wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat. Giant pandas have large molar teeth and strong jaw muscles for crushing tough bamboo.</p>
